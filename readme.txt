The code attached is taken from the nitrous tutorials:
https://community.nitrous.io/tutorials/asynchronous-programming-with-python-3

we simply changed a few parts to suit our needs.

The code can be run on any python 3.5.0 ide and the commands to run are simply:

time python <filename>.py

Then, checking which takes a faster time will help us to see that the asynchronous program runs faster.
